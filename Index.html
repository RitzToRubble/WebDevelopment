              <h2>What is VTEC?</h2>
     <p>
         VTEC is a form of bacterium that can cause diarrhoea and also produces a toxin that is able to damage your bowel wall.<br/>
         People become ill with the virus within 2 to 4 days of being infected but in other cases it could take much longer.<br/>
         It most commonly occurs in the summer and any children under the age of 10 are highly likely to catch it.
                  </p>
         
    <h2>How did I get infected?</h2>     
    <p>
        Contact with farm animals who carry the bacteria in their bowels or in their faeces.<br/>
        Eating food/ drinks that could be contaminated with even a tiny amount of faeces.<br/>
        It can also spread from person to person with contact, most likely happeneing in places like creches, nursing homes and hospitals.<br/>
        If you have a well at home as your main water source, the untreated water in the well can also carry the bacteria.<br/>

         <h1>How do you know you've got it?</h1>
         <p>
             Usually the first symptom is Diarrohea and some other people may also experience vomiting and/or a high temperature.<br/>
             The toxin can cause inflammation of the bowel wall and this can lead to severe stomach cramps and bloody diarrhoea.<br/>
             This can last on average for 6 days but it can range from 2 to 9 days.
             
             Other people may experience very mild or even no symptoms  at all.<br/>
             You would have to give your local doctor a stool sample and have it sent to the hospital lab to check if you've VTEC or not.<br/> 
         </p>
         
    
         <h1>Public health actions in VTEC cases</h1>
         <p>
             VTEC is a notifiable infection. It means that your doctor or a laboratory must report any cases of VTEC to the Department of Public Health.<br/>
             They assess all cases and if you have a strain which produces the toxins then they need to identify if there has been any spread.<br/>
             They do this to prevent any further cases and to protect those who could be at risk of infection.<br/>
             
             <br/><b>**IMPORTANT**</b><br/>
             <B>Infected persons and their contacts who may pose a risk of infection to other people will not be given medical clearance by the public health doctor to return to work, school and child care until they are clear of VTEC.
             </B><br/>
             
             <br/>People who may pose a risk of infection to other people include children under five, healthcare workers, food handlers and some others including older children and adults with disabilites who may not be able to implement good hygiene standards.<br/>
             
             In order to be deemed clear of VTEC you need to be able to provide two negative stool smaples taken 24 hours or more hours apart.<br/>
             
             It can take from as little as <b>one week to several months</b> in some cases to be clear the infection.<br/> If the siutation applies to you, your public health doctor will be able to give you more information.
